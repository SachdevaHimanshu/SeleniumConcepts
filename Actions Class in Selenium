Actions class is an ability provided by Selenium for handling keyboard and mouse events. 

Right Click: action.moveToElement(titleElement).contextClick().build().perform();
  
		//moves the mouse pointer to the element and clicks in the centre.
		action.moveToElement(sliderElement).click().build().perform();
    
		//moves the mouse pointer to the element at the centre then moves it by 50 on x axis and clicks.
		action.moveToElement(sliderElement, 50, 0).click().build().perform();
		
		//moves the mouse pointer to the element at the centre then Clicksandhold and moves it by 90 on x axis and clicks.
		action.moveToElement(sliderElement).clickAndHold().dragAndDropBy(sliderElement, 90, 0).build().perform();
    
     Mouse Actions in Selenium:
doubleClick(): Performs double click on the element
clickAndHold(): Performs long click on the mouse without releasing it
dragAndDrop(): Drags the element from one point and drops to another
moveToElement(): Shifts the mouse pointer to the center of the element
contextClick(): Performs right-click on the mouse


Keyboard Actions in Selenium:

sendKeys(): Sends a series of keys to the element
keyUp(): Performs key release
keyDown(): Performs keypress without release

action.moveToElement(textBoxElement).click().keyDown(Keys.SHIFT).sendKeys("hi my name is himanshu").keyUp(Keys.SHIFT).sendKeys("sachdeva").build().perform();

Action action = actions.build();

Notice that the build method returns the object type of Action. It is basically representing Composite Action which we built from a sequence of multiple actions.
